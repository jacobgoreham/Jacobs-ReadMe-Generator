## [Description](#table-of-contents)

A README.md generator, which will help save time for users that are building projects. This will allow them to spend less time worrying about a README.md and more time coding!

Homewor- I mean this was made for the purpose to help people anywhere who are interested in coding and would like to try it out for themselves!

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

To install this generator for yourself simply clone this repo or copy and paste the code into your local computer. After doing so run install by running "npm install i". After installing node open an integrated terminal and run the generator using "node index.js"

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

To use this generator after running the node index.js command in the terminal, answer the few questions you'll be prompted and you'll be greeted with your nicely set up README.md

For Screenshots of code look into the Pics folder. (Video recorder wasn't working I'm sorry) :(

To test the app on your own system, clone the repo or copy and paste the code manually, then open the code in your code editor and open a an integrated terminal.
